# Numerical PDE
My solutions to some exercises in numerically solving PDE. Many exercises drawn from 

[MIT 16-920j](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-920j-numerical-methods-for-partial-differential-equations-sma-5212-spring-2003/index.htm)

[MIT 18-366](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-366-random-walks-and-diffusion-fall-2006/index.htm)

[MIT 2-29](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-29-numerical-fluid-mechanics-spring-2015/index.htm)

The topics I'm interested in practicing are

- Finite differences for linear and non-linear problems
- Iterative methods, especially multigrid
- Finite elements

For now everything is in python but I may start adding some C++ eventually.
